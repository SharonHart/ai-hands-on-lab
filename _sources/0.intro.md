# Welcome

RAG Applications, based on large language models, are a new breed of application. The architecture has become increasingly important and is currently at the core of most of our engagements. In this workshop, you will go through the core aspects and considerations one should take when working on RAG based GenAI Solutions.

## Goal
By the end of the workshop, you will have a clear(er) understanding of:
- **Pre-production**: how to experiment, evaluate and come up with the best RAG-based solution for a given use case.
- **Post-production**: after deploying the solution to production, how to monitor and ensure that *it works as expected*. Oh wait, what does that even mean?

Through this workshop, we aim to:
- speed up the onboarding process on this topic
- capture key best practices that have already been established in the industry
- provide a framework that would guide you in your thought process when building such applications
- last, but not least, to HAVE FUN!
