# Welcome

In this workshop, you will go through the core aspects and considerations one should take when working on RAG based GenAI Solutions. RAG has become increasingly important and is currently at the core of most of our engagements.

We hope that, by the end of the workshop, you will confidently approach such engagements from two perspectives:
- **Pre-production**: how to experiment, evaluate and come up with the best solution for a given use case.
- **Post-production**: after deploying the solution to production, how to monitor and ensure that *it works as expected*. And in fact, what does that even mean?

During this workshop, you won't encounter things that are not already documented elsewhere. However, we hope to:
- speed up the onboarding process for anyone in ISE
- capture key best practices that have already been established in the industry
- provide a framework that would guide you in your thought process so you can confidently join such engagements
- HAVE FUN!
