    "When processing data in a GG flow, splitting the source documents into chunks requires care and expertise to ensure the resulting chunks are small enough to be effective during fact retrieval but not too small so that enough context is provided during summarization.\n",

    "## Why Chunking Size Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance and Granularity**: A small chunk*size, like 128, yields more granular chunks. This granularity, however, presents a risk: vital information might not be among the top retrieved chunks, especially if the similarity_top_k setting is as restrictive as 2. Conversely, a chunk size of 512 is likely to encompass all necessary information within the top chunks, ensuring that answers to queries are readily available. To navigate this, we employ the \\_Faithfulness and Relevancy* metrics. These measure the absence of ‘hallucinations’ and the ‘relevancy’ of responses based on the query and the retrieved contexts respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response Generation Time**: As the chunk_size increases, so does the volume of information directed into the LLM to generate an answer. While this can ensure a more comprehensive context, it might also slow down the system. Ensuring that the added depth doesn't compromise the system's responsiveness is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, determining the optimal chunk_size is about striking a balance: capturing all essential information without sacrificing speed. It's vital to undergo thorough testing with various sizes to find a configuration that suits the specific use case and dataset.\n",
