    "[Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) is an _architecture_ that augments the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) by adding an _information retrieval system_ that provides grounding data.\n",

    "Why is the information retrieval system important? Because it gives you control over the knowledge that the LLM is using to formulate a response. That means that you can constrain the LLM to your _own content_ sources from _vectorized_ documents, images, and other data formats.\n",

    "[Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/) is a proven solution for information retrieval in a RAG architecture. Architecturally, it sits between the external data stores (with un-indexed data) and your client app. The client app sends query requests to a search index and handles the response:\n",
