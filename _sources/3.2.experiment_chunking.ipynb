    "# 3.2. Chunking Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The search solution is comprised of both **ingestion** and **retrieval**. One does not exist without the other. While other experiments are focused on data retrieval, ingestion plays equal importance in the effectiveness of the search solution. During this experiment, we will look at various chunking strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple methods of ingestion, depending on the type of data. For example, unstructured data such as documents or web pages can be split into chunks and embedded into vectors, while structured data such as tables or databases can be summarized or converted into natural language. In our case, since we are working with unstructured text data, we will look into two chunking strategies: fixed-size chunking and semantic chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Our goal here is not to identify which chunking strategy is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù in general but rather to demonstrate how the choice of chunking may have a non-trivial impact on the ultimate outcome from the RAG solution.\n",

    "## 1. Fixed-sized chunking strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most basic form of splitting up text. It is the process of simply dividing the text into N-character sized chunks regardless of their content or form. This method isn't recommended for any applications - but it's a great starting point for us to understand the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Why Chunking Size Matters](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/evaluating-the-ideal-chunk-size-for-a-rag-system-using-llamaindex-6207e5d3fec5)**\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing data, splitting the source documents into chunks requires care and expertise to ensure the resulting chunks are small enough to be effective during fact retrieval but not too small so that enough context is provided during summarization. The models used to generate embedding vectors have maximum limits on the text fragments provided as input. For example, the maximum length of input text for the Azure OpenAI embedding models is **8,191** tokens. Given that each token is around 4 characters of text for common OpenAI models, this maximum limit is equivalent to around 6000 words of text. If you're using these models to generate embeddings, it's critical that the input text stays under the limit. Partitioning your content into chunks ensures that your data can be processed by the Large Language Models (LLM) used for indexing and queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance and Granularity**: A small chunk size, like 128, yields more granular chunks. This granularity, however, presents a risk: vital information might not be among the top retrieved chunks, especially if the similarity _top_k_ setting is as restrictive as 2. Conversely, a chunk size of 512 is likely to encompass all necessary information within the top chunks, ensuring that answers to queries are readily available. To navigate this, we employ the _Faithfulness and Relevancy_ metrics. These measure the absence of ‚Äòhallucinations‚Äô and the ‚Äòrelevancy‚Äô of responses based on the query and the retrieved contexts respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response Generation Time**: As the chunk_size increases, so does the volume of information directed into the LLM to generate an answer. While this can ensure a more comprehensive context, it might also slow down the system. Ensuring that the added depth doesn't compromise the system's responsiveness is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, determining the optimal chunk_size is about striking a balance: capturing all essential information without sacrificing speed. It's vital to undergo thorough testing with various sizes to find a configuration that suits the specific use case and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros**: Easy & Simple\n",
    "- **Cons**: Very rigid and doesn't take into account the structure of your text\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunk Size** - The number of characters you would like in your chunks. 50, 100, 100,000, etc.\n",
    "- **Chunk Overlap** - The amount you would like your sequential chunks to overlap. This is to try to avoid cutting a single piece of context into multiple pieces. This will create duplicate data across chunks.\n"

      "Most batch ingestion data pipelines will connect to a source system and pull data from it at regular interval. There are two common patterns for a batch job to load data from a source system, full load and delta load. - _Full load_: The job will load all the records from the source table. - _Delta load_: The job will load only the new records added since the last execution of the job. For this approach to work, the source table needs to have a watermark column. ##### Azure Blob Storage Change Feed\n",
