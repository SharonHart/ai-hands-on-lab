    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) is an _architecture_ that augments the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) by adding an _information retrieval system_ that provides grounding data. It is a major architectural pattern for most enterprise GenAI applications, increasingly used in our latest engagements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "RAG is not the only solution for incorporating domain knowledge, as illustrated below:\n",

    "**Information retrieval system**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the information retrieval system important? Because it gives you control over the knowledge that the LLM is using to formulate a response. That means that you can constrain the LLM to your _own content_ sources from _vectorized_ documents, images, and other data formats.\n",

    "**Azure AI Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/) is a proven solution for information retrieval in a RAG architecture. Architecturally, it sits between the external data stores (with un-indexed data) and your client app. The client app sends query requests to a search index and handles the response:\n",

    "For those familiar with relational databases, you can imagine that:\n",

    "  - it describes the [schema of your data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-an-index#schema-of-a-search-index)\n",
    "  - it consists of [`field definitions`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-an-index#field-definitions) described by [`field attributes`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-an-index#field-attributes) (searchable, filterable, sortable etc)\n",

    "Vector search is an approach in information retrieval that stores numeric representations of content for search scenarios.\n",

    "The generally available functionality of vector support requires that you call other libraries or models for data chunking and vectorization.
