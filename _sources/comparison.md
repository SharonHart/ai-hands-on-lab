# Comparison of existing Azure Studios

| Studio name    | Link | Description | Supported models | RAG | 
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Azure Machine Learning Studio |https://ml.azure.com/| A cloud-based platform that allows you to build, train, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. You can use various tools and frameworks, such as Python, R, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, to create custom models for any scenario. You can also leverage automated machine learning and designer features to simplify and accelerate the model development process. |  | |
| Azure AI Studio  | https://ai.azure.com/    | A hub that enables you to explore and use all the Azure AI Services. You can also test and evaluate pre-trained LLMs from various sources, including Microsoft, OpenAI, and Hugging Face, and build innovative solutions with them. Azure AI Studio provides a playground experience for models in addition to those provisioned via Azure OpenAI Studio | OpenAi, Hugging Face, Meta models etc | |
| Azure OpenAI Studio | https://oai.azure.com/     | Web-based interface that allows you to access and deploy pre-trained LLMs from OpenAI (such as GPT-3, Codex). You can use these models to create natural language applications, such as chatbots, assistants, code generators, and more. You can also customize the models with your own data and fine-tune them for specific domains or tasks | OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Embeddings, DALL-E, Whisper) | |
| Azure Copilot Studio    | https://copilotstudio.preview.microsoft.com/    | A **low-code tool** that helps you build your own copilot. You can use Copilot Studio to create conversational AI apps that can answer questions based on your own knowledge bases and data sources. You can also integrate your copilot with Microsoft Teams and other platforms to enable new collaboration scenarios. | | |
