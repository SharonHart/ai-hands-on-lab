These are scored to pick the top few (typically in order of 50) to return to the user or to feed the next layer. Azure AI Search supports three different models:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Keyword: Uses traditional full-text search methods – content is broken into terms through language-specific text analysis, inverted indexes are created for fast retrieval, and the BM25 probabilistic model is used for scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Vector: Documents are converted from text to vector representations using an embedding model. Retrieval is performed by generating a query embedding and finding the documents whose vectors are closest to the query’s. We used Azure Open AI text-embedding-ada-002 (Ada-002) embeddings and cosine similarity for all our tests in this post.\n",
    "  - Hybrid: Performs both keyword and vector retrieval and applies a fusion step to select the best results from each technique. Azure AI Search currently uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to produce a single result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ranking – also called L2, takes a subset of the top L1 results and computes higher quality relevance scores to reorder the result set. The L2 can improve the L1's ranking because it applies more computational power to each result. The L2 ranker can only reorder what the L1 already found – if the L1 missed an ideal document, the L2 can't fix that. L2 ranking is critical for RAG applications to make sure the best results are in the top positions.\n",
    "  - Semantic ranking is performed by Azure AI Search's L2 ranker which utilizes multi-lingual, deep learning models adapted from Microsoft Bing. The Semantic ranker can rank the top 50 results from the L1.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/azure-ai-search-outperforming-vector-search-with-hybrid/ba-p/3929167 -->\n",

    "There are [various types of search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/use-your-data?tabs=ai-search#search-options) that one can perform such as: keyword search, semantic search, vector search, hybrid search. Since we generated embeddings for our chunks and we would like to leverage the power of vector search, in this baseline solution we will perform a simple vector search.

Examples include VS Code, Devcontainers and/or GitHub Codespaces. The development environment uses a code repository to store the code that's written. Additional components, such as libraries, frameworks, container base images, are retrieved from a component registry.\\n\\nRepeatable and deterministic builds are an important aspect of a secure software supply chain. These ensure that the contents that make up a software release are well known, and any attempts to tamper with the artifacts can be detected. The development ecosystem used within the develop phase must ensure a record of all the dependencies is captured. Examples of this component inventory include application package managers (npm, NuGet, go.mod), OS package managers (winget, apt get), and container manifests (dockerfile). Version pinning of components from the component registry is encouraged to ensure that builds remain deterministic.\",\n",
