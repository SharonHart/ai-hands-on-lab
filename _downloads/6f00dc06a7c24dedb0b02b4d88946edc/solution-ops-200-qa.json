Object storage is decoupled from the compute and provides a low-cost option for storing a large amount of data.\n\nData access patterns for analytical systems are different from transactional systems. A common example is, accessing a particular attribute or column for large number of records. This made columnar data formats a popular choice for fast analytics workloads.\n\nFor detailed information, see DataOps: Storage.\n\nData Pipeline Operability\n\nData Pipeline Operability refers to a set of best practices that span the entire lifecycle of a data pipeline. All data pipelines read data from a source and write it to a target location with or without transformation. Due to this similarity in the nature of data pipelines, they share a common set of best practices.\n\nFor detailed information, see DataOps: Data Pipeline Operability.\n\nConfig Driven Data Pipelines",
