A baseline dataset could be kept static, or it could be updated or merged with new data, providing that no drift has been detected.

The baseline dataset can be fixed or we can update (or merge) it to new one if no drift has been detected.

On the other hand, one of the advantages of using ESO with K8S APIs is partial disconnected scenario support since it uses native K8s secrets. The cluster can be offline without any implications on restarting and scaling pods while offline. However, some disadvantages of this method are that the GitOps repo must contain the name of the Key Vault within the SecretStore/ClusterSecretStore or a ConfigMap linking to it, and the secrets must be created as K8s secrets (Source: data\\docs\\code-with-engineering\\continuous-delivery\\gitops\\secret-management\\README.md, chunk85_13).

To scale your system, prioritize techniques like batching, sharding, and caching over eventual consistency, which should be a last resort.
